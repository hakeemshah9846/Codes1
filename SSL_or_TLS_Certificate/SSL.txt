For HTTPS we need to generate a Digital certificate in our server
But it is expensive for us to generate Digital certificate from authorized sources
Free Digital certificates are available from authorized sourced but have some limitations
So we use self signed certificate
Command to generate a self signed certificate : 
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
